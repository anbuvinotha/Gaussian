# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import numpy as np
2. Get the input values
3. Find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian elimination
4. End the program

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.
Developed by: Anbu Vinotha.S
RegisterNumber:23013363 
# To print L and U matrix
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu
A = np.array(eval(input()))
P,L,U=lu(A)
print(L)
print(U)
*/
```

## Output!
![output](<gaussian ss.png>)elimination]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
